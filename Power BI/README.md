# Ocerra Power BI - Aging Report and Dashboard
In this demo, Iâ€™m planning to use Power BI tool for Accounts Payable Aging Report. Power BI is gaining popularity for Ad-hoc reporting tools for Accountants and Financial analysts. The Accounts Payable Aged Report allows you to see how much money you owe per supplier per date. Many suppliers have different payment terms, and you want to prioritize your processing accordingly. 
One of the most commonly used ways to visually explore data in Power BI is using OData connection. In Ocerra we support OData for all accounts out of the box and exposing all required for your reports.
